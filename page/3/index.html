        <p>Just spent an hour or two looking for low cost pressure switches to use on the CEB Press.  I would like to add them as a way to add reliable sensing of end cylinder stopping points.  This avoids the need for external sensors to determine when to stop primary and secondary movements.  I will still need sensors to know when the primary cylinder should stop growing the compression chamber as well as one to know when the secondary cylinder should stop for a compression stage.  However, with just 2 sensors instead of 6, it should be a fair bit simpler to use physical switches instead of the unreliable hall effect sensors.</p>
<p>The sensor I found to use is <a href="http://ecatalog.gemssensors.com/ecatalog/pressure-switches/en/209667" title="this one" target="_blank" rel="external">this one</a>.  It is $32 adjustable from 1000-3000 psi and rated for maximum 6000 psi overload.</p>
<p>There is one at the surplus center <a href="https://www.surpluscenter.com/item.asp?item=9-6278&amp;catname=hydraulic" title="here" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>, but the one they sent me was used and broken, there is no datasheet that exactly matches what they sell and there are only 3 left in stock which means that they aren’t going to be able to be used by many more people.  I’d rather find a solution that can be easily replicated.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>Here are the design requirements I used when searching for a home and hot water heating system:</p>
<ul>
<li>cheap</li>
<li>simple</li>
<li>passable by building department (Indiana code follows IBC)</li>
<li>low co2/pollutant emissions</li>
<li>expandable to include, but not require solar collectors</li>
<li>provide domestic hot water</li>
<li>provide 100% of backup heat (when the sun isn’t shining) via radiant floors for 700 square foot, highly insulated passive solar house</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Electricity">Electricity</h1><p>There are two primary ways to heat water with electricity. One is with a heating element which is how almost all residential hot water systems work, and the other is with a heat pump. Heat pumps can be 2 - 3 times more efficient, but are more complicated, expensive, and are most efficient when it is hot out - exactly when a solar hot water system would be better. Resistive heat is how most electric hot water heaters work. On <a href="http://greenecon.net/how-to-measure-fuel-efficiency-energy-costs-and-carbon-emissions-for-home-heating/energy_economics.html" target="_blank" rel="external">this</a> table, this kind of heat is both the most expensive and emits the most co2 out of all options. Though, this comparison doesn’t take into account that all other forms of heat require that you vent some of your warm conditioned air to the outside, see Natural Gas below. It also doesn’t take into account other issues such as local air quality (with wood), pollution and non-co2 environmental effects such as <a href="http://www.dangersoffracking.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">fraking</a> and <a href="http://www1.ucsc.edu/currents/02-03/01-06/mercury.html" target="_blank" rel="external">mercury rain</a>. On the other hand, it is quite simple to set up a space or baseboard heater, and if you don’t need much heat from it, it may be easier to go with that than to put a bunch of thought into a more complex system.  Instant electric water heaters are simple to integrate into a simple radiant floor system.</p>
<p>If you don’t actually want hot water all the time and you are only installing an automatic hot water system to meet code and don’t intend to use it, electric hot water has one of the lowest up front costs, at around $210 (installed) for an instant hot water heater and $250 (installed) for a smallish 40 gallon tank heater. For the tank heater you will need a 50A 240V breaker which is $10 and some 8-3 wire to your box (15’ is $30). An instant hot water tank will require a larger breaker and larger wire about $10 more expensive. Depending on the other appliances in your house, this could require a larger panel or service to your house, which could quickly add more cost.</p>
<h1 id="Wood">Wood</h1><p>Purchasing wood costs about the same as gas <a href="http://www.builditsolar.com/References/Calculators/Fuels/FuelCompare.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">2</a>. Obviously, growing your own is also an option. I would be interested to see how much space and how many nutrients are required to grow enough wood to heat a home. I was hoping to be able to use a heat exchanger around the fire to provide hot water when the sun isn’t shining, but code requires that we have hot water available at all times, and so this is not an option. They also disallow all forms of DIY water heating … you must use only UL listed appliances. Even if code isn’t an issue, another down side is that we couldn’t use it to get hot water in the spring summer and fall without heating the house at the same time. In the summer, a fairly simple solar hot water collector should suffice for hot water, but it gets a little harder in the spring and fall.</p>
<p>Another down side to the wood stove, is up front cost. On craigslist I’ve found stoves for $300 or so, then at least another $400 for chimney, cap, roof connection, etc. In addition, cheap wood stoves on craigslist tend to be much larger than we need for our house, and very inefficient. We are building in a fairly high density area (30 adults / acre) and with everyone using this kind of heat, air quality would suffer very quickly. Stoves with a gasification step tend to have very low emissions and high efficiency. An efficient stove properly sized for our small house would be $800 instead of $300. Here are some small wood stove options:</p>
<ul>
<li>$300 + shipping - <a href="http://www.fatscostoves.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.fatscostoves.com/</a> (unknown if it has a gasifier or is efficient)</li>
<li>$1000 + shipping - <a href="http://www.jotul.com/en-US/wwwjotulus/Main-menu/Products/Wood/Wood-stoves/Jotul-F-602-CB/" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.jotul.com/en-US/wwwjotulus/Main-menu/Products/Wood/Wood-stoves/Jotul-F-602-CB/</a></li>
<li>$1100 + shipping - <a href="http://www.marinestove.com/sardineinfo.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">http://www.marinestove.com/sardineinfo.htm</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Another option for wood is to build a rocket mass heater. (unless code requires UL listed appliances like it does here) These can be very efficient, low emissions and built by hand using materials that cost less than $100 total. They are quite large, so they should be taken into account when designing a space. It is cheap, but requires you heat your house if you want hot water, which isn’t always wanted. This kind of system could wind up being ideal if you have the time and space for one as well as the flexibility to try it out for a year in combination with a solar hot water system and try to balance them out so that your solar collectors heat the water in all of the times that you don’t want to start a fire inside. I look forward to experimenting with this type of system.</p>
<h1 id="Solar">Solar</h1><p>A good solar hot water system is either quite expensive - typically starting at $1000 or will require a bit more time researching DIY systems. I think that in the future, I would like to do this research or spend this money, but right now, I have other priorities. This is the reason for the design requirement above of a system which doesn’t require, but could easily be altered to take advantage of solar hot water.  We are already incorporating passive solar heating ideas into our house, so heating with solar hot water doesn’t make much sense.  The only time we will need extra heat is when the sun isn’t shining.</p>
<h1 id="Propane">Propane</h1><p>Propane is very similar to natural gas.  It doesn’t require a gas line, which can be helpful. The fuel tends to be 40% more expensive than natural gas and emits 20-30% more CO2 <a href="http://greenecon.net/how-to-measure-fuel-efficiency-energy-costs-and-carbon-emissions-for-home-heating/energy_economics.html" target="_blank" rel="external">1</a>. One of the other disadvantages of propane is that it is a bit harder to find cheap large used propane water heaters around here.</p>
<h1 id="Natural_Gas">Natural Gas</h1><p>In a small house like ours, a typical hot water heater is about the right size to use for heating water for a radiant floor heat system. On a very cold day with no sun, our house will need about 130,000 BTU per day <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ArbuNNdbkAsRdFFVWFo1eFB2TFhCNTJmZjVSRUloR1E#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="external">3</a>. A <a href="http://www.menards.com/main/water-heaters/residential/richmond-40-gal-natural-gas-6-year-tall-water-heater/p-200203-c-8690.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">typical hot water heater</a> is rated for 36,000 BTU per hour or 864,000 BTU per day, which is more than enough to heat our house on a very cold day. It may also be possible to use a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Excel-Natural-Ventfree-tankless-heater/dp/B002ATWR8W/ref=sr_1_17?s=kitchen-bath&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357439485&amp;sr=1-17&amp;keywords=gas+tankless" target="_blank" rel="external">very small instant hot water heater</a>. One problem with a natural gas heater is that it requires fresh air to burn and so most furnaces and hot water heaters suck warm inside air past the flame and then vent it outside. Not only do you lose warm inside air, sucking air through the heater causes cold air to be pulled in through cracks near windows and doors, which are already colder than the rest of the house. The vents for a small house tend to be around the same size as the vents for a large one, and so the effect is proportionately greater. That said, some small gas space heaters can be ventless and cheap ($120), but there are too many horror stories for me, especially in a well sealed house. People <a href="http://www.dukefire.com/articles/article/3941815/60120.htm" target="_blank" rel="external">complain</a> about high carbon monoxide levels, lots of condensation which wind up on the windows and rotting the wood, health problems, etc. There are some gas heaters which are direct vent, which means they suck outside air to burn and then vent the exhaust, but they are more expensive ($400) and of unknown efficiency. <a href="http://www.northerntool.com/shop/tools/product_200362087_200362087" target="_blank" rel="external">This heater</a> could be a good option if there is already a gas line to the house.</p>
<h1 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h1><p>We are building two houses this year. In our house we will heat with electric instant hot water through a radiant floor and in the rental, we will use a wood stove. Both will likely use electric hot water tanks (for code, with DIY solar hot water and wood heat exchangers soon to follow).</p>

        <p>We had some gaps between boards that were 1/8” that were not a problem, but I would not go much bigger than that.  The aggregate is what determines how big an acceptable gap might be.  The aggregate we used was typical for a footer, and some of the bigger pieces were maybe an inch in one dimension.</p>

        <p>We have been making CEBs one weekend and then laying them over the next few weekends, which means we needed a way to safely store them. We stack them on pallets and then cover them with tarps and metal roofing. Our tarps are old and have some small holes, and if that hole happens to be at a gap in the blocks, a valley will form that collects and drips large amount of water to the blocks below. The metal roofing protects against the rain and the tarps ensure that the blocks dry slowly, which is good for their strength.</p>

        <p>I couldn’t find any cheap conveyors around here that had rollers that were close enough together to work for the CEBs. I found and bought one conveyor, but the rollers are too far apart, and so the blocks bounce around rather than roll smoothly. Instead of spending a hundreds or thousands of dollars for a new conveyor, we built this slide with a large 2x12, some 2x2s and some stainless steel flashing, and it has been working well:</p>
<p><a href="http://dwiel.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/IMG_20130813_175114.jpg" target="_blank" rel="external"></a></p>
<p>Concrete blocks, CEBs and wood hold the slide up at the right height. A heavy block is placed at the end of the slide to keep it from getting pushed away from press when it gets full. We had a few accidents where the whole slide fell over when it got really full and we didn’t have a weight at the end.</p>

        <p>Last night, Nate and I were able to sucessfully and intuitively control up to 3 or 4 individual drums based on different sounds vocalized into a mic. The bass drum would play when ‘oooh’ was sung, a snare when ‘eee’ was sung and a cymbal when ‘aaah’ was sung.  There are still some kinks in the system, but as a proof of concept, it works fairly well.  The mapping between input sound and MIDI event are learned in real time so you are not restricted to different vowel sounds.  The 3 distinguishing sounds could have just as easily been a clap, growl and whistle.  The code: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/fftknn/" target="_blank" rel="external">fftknn</a>.</p>

        <p>So I’ve been experimenting with generating swarms and was able to get some basic code working pretty quickly thanks to some <a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/data/articles/article.asp?article=06" target="_blank" rel="external">Particle Systems</a> example code on <a href="http://nehe.gamedev.net/" target="_blank" rel="external">NeHe</a>.

<p>I think the next step is going to be to get multiple swarms each operating on different rules in the same space interacting.</p>

<p>also make sure you have <em>python-cairo-dev libgstreamer0.10-dev libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev</em> installed.  There may be more required, but these were the only ones I didn’t already have installed.</p>
<p>For some reason I had to configure all of these libraries with –prefix /usr to get pycluster to see all of them.</p>
<p>Also, configure pycluster with –enable-docs if you want any documentation.</p>
<p>have fun!</p>

        <p>Here is how you can have your makefile build your tolua++ .cpp and .h files for you.  It should work for plain tolua also.</p>

<p>this will generate tolua_file.cpp and tolua_file.h files from corresponding file.pkg files anytime they the .cpp or .h file is depended on somewhere else in the file.  In my case I just added tolua_file.o to my list of objects.  Here is the full makefile for the project which required this - for reference:</p>
