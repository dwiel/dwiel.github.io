        <p>This error message most often occurrs when trying to run web.py on an invalid address and port.  An example of an invalid address would be  example.net, instead of a proper ip address like 98.228.37.242.</p>
<h2 id="Other_Causes:">Other Causes:</h2><p>Was just trying to get a simple web.py test running:</p>

<p>The problem was that due to the way web.py loading works, you need to have the creation and running of the app only occur if this is the main entry point of the program.  Otherwise, the class loader in web.py will reload this file again later, and wind up spawning a new server when its intent was simply to load a class:</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2015/10/02/raspberry-pi-timelapse-camera/"> Raspberry Pi Timelapse Camera </a></h1>
  

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>Some steps I took to build my Raspberry Pi Timelapse camera:</p>
<p>Power</p>
<p>The location of the timelapse camera puts it about 400 feet from the nearest building with electricity, so I figured it might make sense to put it on solar power and a battery, but it turns out to be prohibitively expensive.  Even by piecing together a system myself from panels on ebay, car batteries, a home made controller, etc, it was still going to wind up costing at least $400.  400 feet of 12/2 cable is only around $120.  Also, in a year or two, the electricity run will be shortened by a new power service installed near by.  So for power, I am just going to run some cable from the house.  There will be some voltage drop, but that shouldn’t be a problem, it won’t be much.</p>
<p>Enclosure</p>
<p>I spent a long time trying to figure out what kind of enclosure I should build or use to hold everything.  I wanted something that I could open and close relatively easily (in case I needed to repair it).  Turns out the easiest thing to use was a 8” x 8” x 4” junction box I found in the electrical section of a hardware store.  It is much bigger than I needed, but it was the smallest I could find that would fit the raspberry pi with a cable sticking out both the USB port and the power port, which comes out to about 8”.</p>
<p>Camera</p>
<p>The camera I am using is a Nikon S3000.  I made sure that it was in the <a href="http://gphoto.org/proj/libgphoto2/support.php" target="_blank" rel="external">list of cameras supported by gphoto2</a>.  Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to use the build of gphoto2 that is in the debian package manager because it is too old, so I downloaded and built the latest versions of libgphoto2 and gphoto2 from source.</p>
<p>Code</p>
<p>I wrote a basic python script which will take pictures every 5 minutes.  But then, for some reason on the raspberrypi, I’ve been having trouble controlling the camera.  Every few commands I send to the camera, the usb connection fails.  I have to issue a usbreset to get it back working, so I added some code to do that automatically before running every command.  Also added some code to only take pictures during the day (in Bloomington, Indiana) which uses a nifty library which will give sunrise and sunset times for any day given a latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>All code is open source and available <a href="https://github.com/dwiel/gphoto2-timelapse" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a>.</p>
<p>Mounting:</p>
<p>I’ve mounted the camera to a small piece of scrap plywood and the plywood to a tree, with the camera facing both of the building sites that we are working on this year</p>
<p>What is the one feature you see as missing?</p>

    <h1 class="title"><a href="/2015/10/02/ceb-press-first-bricks/"> CEB Press First Bricks </a></h1>
  

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <p><iframe frameborder="0" height="300" src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/47486225" width="400"></iframe><br>We’ve made 15 bricks with our <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/CEB_Press" target="_blank" rel="external">CEB Press</a> so far. We’ve tried a few different mixes:</p>
<p>first layer clay soil only<br>first layer clay soil only with 2 quarts water per 5 gallons of soil<br>subsoil clay</p>
<p>Note that we’ve been in a pretty serious drought lately, so the soil is all very dry. The subsoil was more moist than the first layer of clay. The subsoil started about 2 ft down and was more red in color than the first layer.</p>
<p>All of the bricks have minor cracks in them, though the ones with added water are worst, as are the ones which were dried in the sun. One of the first layer clay only bricks was dropped from increasingly higher distances until it broke in half at a 5ft fall after 2 days of curing. It appeared to be more dry on the outside surface than on the inside, which leads me to believe<br>that it would have been even stronger had it cured for longer.</p>
<p>The shaker motor was tested and seems to shake the machine quite well. Still need to work on the controller board to get all solenoids operable and automatic.</p>
<p>I looked into buying a <a href="http://opensourceecology.org/wiki/Power_Cube" target="_blank" rel="external">Power Cube</a> for the work party, but it doesn’t seem like it will be able to be manufactured in time. On the other hand, we may get away with renting only one tractor which will both till and load soil into the CEB hopper. That leaves Danny’s parents’ tracktor to power the CEB press. However, the CEB press could benefit from faster gpm flow as the tractor we have is only 14 gpm compared to the rental units which can do 30 gpm. This would speed up brick making by about 2x. If we have many people out to help, this could significantly improve the efficiency of the operation, and may be worth the extra cost. On days when the CEB Press was not the bottleneck, Danny’s parents’ tractor could be used to power the CEB.  The efficiency of construction with CEB blocks seems to be reliant on how to make sure that every step in chain from digging soil out of the ground to setting into the wall is happening at the same pace.  If one step is slow, it will slow down all of the rest.</p>
<p>It would be nice to have a power source for the CEB in general, so we don’t always have to bring danny’s tractor down in order to use it. If someone else around town wanted to use the CEB press, then it would be much easier to loan them the press and power cube, but not danny’s tractor. They could also be instructed to rent machine X from the rental place … 5x 1 week rentals = cost of power cube</p>

        <p>I’ve received new information and so have updated the post.  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/adobe/message/8980" target="_blank" rel="external">Quoting Dan Johnson</a></p>
<p>It can be expected that a  standard brick wall will have water penetration from weather on the the exterior and possibly condensation on the inside.  Many wall designs today have a brick veneer- space for drainage-rigid foam- framing,cmu, etc. For this reason weep holes are used to allow the water a point of exit.  However, a CEB wall that is plastered on the exterior or even covered with another type of cladding,  should not have that issue so no need for weep holes.  If the wall was left unplastered/exposed then it could have that issue and you would need weep holes but I would not recommend that for a cold rainy climate unless you had a really well stabilized block.</p>
<h2 id="Old_(Incorrect)_Post:">Old (Incorrect) Post:</h2><p>If water pools on the foundation and soaks the bricks, they will loose their structural integrity. We need 1/4” ID copper pipe and cotton rope inside every 4-6ft between the foundation and the first course of bricks as weep holes. The bricks are 6” wide and if weep holes are installed every 4 feet along all 94’ of the building’s outside perimeter that means we’ll want 24 weep holes. 24 holes * 6” deep holes &rarr; 12’ of copper pipe and cotton rope.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>I’ve heard multiple people ask for a way to see a list of locally bound variables in python.  It would be especially useful for use in the interactive prompt.  They like the interface that matlab gave them and this is one of the features they miss the most.  I’m not sure what the best way to accomplish this is, but I’ve coded together one solution.  Here is an example use case:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> boundvars <span class="keyword">import</span> boundvars</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">test</span><span class="params">()</span> :</span></span><br><span class="line">         a = <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">         b = <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">         <span class="keyword">assert</span> boundvars(vars()) == &#123;<span class="string">'a'</span>: <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="string">'b'</span>: <span class="number">2</span>&#125;</span><br><span class="line">         <span class="keyword">import</span> urllib</span><br><span class="line">         <span class="keyword">assert</span> boundvars(vars()) == &#123;<span class="string">'a'</span>: <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="string">'b'</span>: <span class="number">2</span>&#125;</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">x = <span class="number">1</span></span><br><span class="line">y = <span class="number">2</span></span><br><span class="line">boundvars(vars())</span><br><span class="line">= &#123;<span class="string">'y'</span>: <span class="number">2</span>, <span class="string">'x'</span>: <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="string">'test'</span>: &lt;function test at <span class="number">0x0000</span>&gt;&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">from</span> urllib <span class="keyword">import</span> *</span><br><span class="line">boundvars(vars())</span><br><span class="line">= &#123;<span class="string">'x'</span>: <span class="number">1</span>, <span class="string">'y'</span>: <span class="number">2</span>, <span class="string">'test'</span> : &lt;function test at <span class="number">0x0000</span>&gt;&#125;</span><br><span class="line"> </span><br><span class="line">test()</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>As you can see, boundvars is called with vars() as a parameter which then returns a dictionary of locally bound variables.  If boundvars.ignore_external_functions is set to False, the first two calls which show x and y bound would also show the variable boundvars.  If it is set to True, then all values which are functions not defined in the <strong>main</strong>  module are excluded from the output dictionary.  The latest code can be downloaded below.  Installation is as simple as:</p>
<p>$ wget <a href="http://dwiel.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/boundvars.tar.gz" target="_blank" rel="external">http://dwiel.net/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/boundvars.tar.gz</a><br>$ tar -xvf boundvars.tar.gz<br>$ cd boundvars<br>$ sudo python setup.py install</p>
<p>Its not big enough to warrant a project at a code hosting service so its just provided here.  If you know of any way that this module could be improved (or avoided by some cool function I don’t know about) please, let me know!</p>
