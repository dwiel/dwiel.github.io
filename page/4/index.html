        <p>Awesome idea for later:</p>
<p>Cast a 3” or larger <a href="http://www.nmri.go.jp/eng/khirata/metalwork/basic/bolt/index_e.html" target="_blank" rel="external">tap</a> to cut large threads into window sill. Make same size threaded wooden plug that can screw in tightly. Remove plug to check on insulation in the sill.  Alternatively, could hold a wooden block in place that makes a perfect fit in a square hole and use embedded magnets to pull it out.</p>
<p>This can all be done later though.  We could start by leaving it sealed up and drilling/cutting a hole in it later to check on things.</p>

<p>There are some good more wall and material types along with their ratings on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_transmission_class" target="_blank" rel="external">Sound Transmission Class</a> wikipedia page.  For reference, at 50 db, “very loud sounds such as musical instruments or a stereo can be faintly heard; 99% of population not annoyed” and at 60 db, “superior soundproofing; most sounds inaudible”.</p>
<p>It seems that with both straw bale and CEB walls will provide significant sound proofing and that the weakest link is likely going to be in the windows and doors.</p>
<p>This is how people who are really picky about sound proofing do it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_chamber" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="/images/rf_anechoic_chamber.jpg" alt="None"></a>.</p>

        <p>It appears no to matter much, but around here (Bloomington, Indiana) the most common rot resistant woods are Black Locust, White Oak and Cedar. I might just wind up using poplar because it is easy to source and cheap. Especially for the wood parts that aren’t in direct contact with the CEBs. Not sure if black Locust everywhere that touches the CEBs is overkill …</p>
<p>Tip seems to think that poplar should be fine, especially if it is coated with pine tar in places it touches the CEBs.</p>

        <p>We have multiple wheelbarrows for moving blocks from the <a href="http://dwiel.net/blog/ceb-press-slide" target="_blank" rel="external">slide</a> to the <a href="http://dwiel.net/blog/ceb-tarping" target="_blank" rel="external">pallets</a> where we store them, but this one is the easiest and lightest. The bucket of a standard wheel barrow was removed and these pieces of wood were screwed on in its place. I’m not sure it would be worth removing the bucket from an otherwise functioning wheelbarrow, but this one is definitely easier to use than the others.</p>

        <p>It was great to take a night off and relax with Shaina and Tulsi tonight. I feel like I’m winding up my rubber band of motivation more and more every minute I spend time with them. It’s hard not to keep thinking about it, but I think some subconscious slow thinking will probably do us all good.</p>
<p>I’m very excited to start posting more regular updates on our house design.  Especially how certain design decisions were made, and all of the reasoning behind them. Good pictures of each step will be great to have. If anyone is going to be building houses with the CEB Press in the future, it would be nice if they didn’t have to figure out all of the same things that we did.</p>
<p>Perhaps a better format for all of this would be a wiki, rather than a blog or a blog that I edit like a wiki perhaps …</p>
<p>Adding pictures to the site should be easy. Its not quite there yet, though I guess it kinda is …</p>

        <p>I keep getting emails asking to please visit this website and vote for Obama, or sign up to this Obama facebook group.  I like Obama and I plan on voting for him, I really do.  I like showing my support for him and letting anyone who is interested know what I think.  However, I could spend every hour of the day joining Obama facebook groups and voting for him in various polls.  This is not a productive use of my time.  I want to publish the fact that I support Obama, and be done with it.  Let this be the informal declaration.  I hope to have a framework which would allow people to make declarations of this type, which could then be read and understood by computers, and then analyzed and viewed by anyone and everyone who is interested.  There could even be a facebook/myspace app. <em>sigh</em> Say it once, have it published, and moveon.</p>

    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>So I’ve been reading a <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/1580085792" target="_blank" rel="external">book</a> by Paul Stamets who has given one of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ted.com%2Findex.php%2Ftalks%2Fpaul_stamets_on_6_ways_mushrooms_can_save_the_world.html&amp;ei=8tcqSZqBHMTH-QbM0tWVAg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEOR_dvq60CMHQ3B669Yt863SPUgQ&amp;sig2=ILCUQ-CGu7sNkhoDy0Bpng" target="_blank" rel="external">the best TED talks</a> I’ve ever seen, and I watched a lot of them.  The book is fantasy meets scifi meets reality; I’m really enjoying it.  I’m currently reading one of the chapters covering medicinal uses of mushrooms and am really amazed.  One small study of 30 people found that oyster mushrooms could reduce LDL (bad) cholesterol by 30%.  There are 37 results for ‘pleurotus ostreatus cholesterol’ on <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/" target="_blank" rel="external">pubmed</a> (sorry they don’t allow linking to searches).  Many are on animals like rats and rabbits which seem to support the study sited by the book.  It seems to be a fairly well researched phenomenon.</p>
<p>This begs the question: Is there a reason why doctors do not prescribe oyster mushrooms?  Is there a reason why they don’t at least suggest them?  You can even find them freeze-dried, powered and capsulized so you can get the placebo effect of eating pills if thats what you need.  All of the information I was able to dig up as a layman was supportive of the idea that they helped lower LDL cholesterol.</p>
<p>So I talked to a friend of mine Elizabeth who knows a bit more about the medical industry than I do (she’s recieved grant money to do medical imaging research on mice).  Her basic response was that no pharmeseutical corperation is going to fund this kind of research.  Mostly since they couldn’t patent a mushroom as common as the oyster which doesn’t even need extracting or processing to become medically useful.  I was hoping for a less synical response, but alas, it was the best one I could find.  Anyone else have any ideas about this?</p>
<p>My next thought (a fairly predictable one if you know me at all) is how we could get around this limitation through distributed cooperation rather than concentrated power and money.  What kind of experiments could we perform by having thousands of people assist from home with.  Could they try eating oyster mushrooms and looking for a change in cholesterol level?  What kind of procedures in a lab would be hard to reproduce and which would be easier?  I understand that this kind of experiment or data mining, wouldn’t be of the same rigorous type as one performed by scientists in a lab, but could we not still learn a great deal about it?  How would a system which allowed for these kinds of experiments operate?  Does this already exist?</p>

        <p>I had a great meeting with <a href="http://dwiel.net/tip" target="_blank" rel="external">Tip</a>, a nice day out in town and then pressed a few more bricks. One of the best parts of the meeting with Tip was his change of mind in the difficulty of building our own windows and doors. This was one of the last jobs that he didn’t think we’d be able to do, and I feel confident now that we can do it, and that we can get exactly what we want by doing it that way.</p>
<p>Also got some other questions answered by Tip, though it seems like there are always a million more. It seems like we are starting to gain the confidence in ourselves to not have to ask Tip about each and every detail.</p>
<p>We pressed some bricks with added lime &amp; sand, just lime and just sand. They definitely feel much stronger and solid. Will be interesting to see how they dry. There were some bricks that were made from some pretty big sized aggregate that turned out pretty bad, but the others are looking pretty good.</p>
<p>Also got a switch installed to control the shaker motor which seems to be doing its job pretty well.  We added some zipties and carboard to the hydraulic cables in an effort to reduce rubbing so that they last longer. It was a little tricky, mostly because the line to the primary cylinder isn’t long enough and so is pretty taught and inflexible.  This made it hard to ziptie it in a way that would prevent it from rubbing.</p>
