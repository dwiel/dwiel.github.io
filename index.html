    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>Today I spent some time looking into automatic windows. Could windows be automatically be opened when the indoor and outdoor temperatures are at the right place? There are some windows we plan to put in the lofted area that will be too high to easily reach. These could also benefit from automatic window opening.</p>
<p>It seems that most solutions are pretty expensive. The cheapest/easiest solution seems to be using linear actuators. There are also <a href="http://rollertrol.com/store/en/71-window-openers" target="_blank" rel="external">window openers</a> specifically made for this, but they tend to be even more expensive ($170) .</p>
<p>It seems that a lot of cost could be saved if regular DC motors could be fashioned to be used instead of pricey linear actuators. The actuators don’t get much cheaper than <a href="http://www.robotshop.com/firgelli-automation-9-stroke-150lb-force-linear-actuator.html" target="_blank" rel="external">$110</a>. DC motors would require more complex arrangement with chain or string and likely one for opening and one for closing the windows. These could probably be done, but would require quite a bit of experimentation first. It would cost significantly less, probably closer to $75 complete instead of $150 complete. These could be added later to double hung windows. One problem with these is that they can’t lock the window closed, also if the window is opened manually, the string will get messed up. Some kind of geared belt system might work better, but that gets way more complex …</p>
<p>One down side to the linear actuators is that due to the large cylinder, they might not be easy to fit in between a window and its screen. They make sense for casement windows and awning windows, but are more difficult for double hung windows. We have the benefit of 2’ deep walls, so it should be relatively easy to install a large 12” linear actuator in between our awning windows and their screen.</p>
<p>I also found <a href="http://www.window-openers.com/plug/_in/_electric_opener.html" target="_blank" rel="external">these</a> that seem to be reasonably priced and could fit in a much smaller space (it is 7 cm wide). They run on 24V. The actuator itself costs just around $100 + UK VAT? + shipping. They also come with lots of options for building a system with their accessories (power supply, remotes, etc.) One problem with these is that they are much less powerful than the general purpose linear actuators and only extend to 15cm (5.9 inches). You could mount them closer to the hinge to make the 5.9 inch opening act like more but I wouldn’t be confident that they would be strong enough to open the window with that kind of leverage.</p>
<p>One thing to consider before building, is that we might be able to run any necessary wiring through the walls, which I think would be preferable. Especially for above greenhouse windows. Another possibility is for double hung windows to have linear actuator built up into the wall, like in a lintel or something … The problem is that if we want the window to open 30 inches, there needs to be a 30 inch actuator inside …</p>
<p>Yet another possibility is making the linear actuators themselves out of a DC motor or servomotor. There are <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=diy+linear+actuator" target="_blank" rel="external">lots of designs</a>, and they are really quite simple. The hardest part would be calculating the size of motor necessary to get the amount of force desired.</p>
<p>After all of this, I’ve decided that automatic windows are definitely not worth it at this point.  I will still need to come up with a method for opening the windows that will be too high to open in a typical fashion, but will likely just use a simple manual pulley or push bar system.  To be determined …</p>

        <p>Awesome idea for later:</p>
<p>Cast a 3” or larger <a href="http://www.nmri.go.jp/eng/khirata/metalwork/basic/bolt/index_e.html" target="_blank" rel="external">tap</a> to cut large threads into window sill. Make same size threaded wooden plug that can screw in tightly. Remove plug to check on insulation in the sill.  Alternatively, could hold a wooden block in place that makes a perfect fit in a square hole and use embedded magnets to pull it out.</p>
<p>This can all be done later though.  We could start by leaving it sealed up and drilling/cutting a hole in it later to check on things.</p>

I was pretty surprised by how well they grip the block and am not as worried about hurting them as I used to.  I was able to lift the block using two screws which means they were each holding around 15 pounds.  I am still a bit weary of attaching anything very heavy like shelves, cabinets or counter tops to them, but I’m thinking that hanging mirrors, pictures, etc should be fine.  More experimenting to come.  Any experiments you would like me to try?</p>

<p>There are some good more wall and material types along with their ratings on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_transmission_class" target="_blank" rel="external">Sound Transmission Class</a> wikipedia page.  For reference, at 50 db, “very loud sounds such as musical instruments or a stereo can be faintly heard; 99% of population not annoyed” and at 60 db, “superior soundproofing; most sounds inaudible”.</p>
<p>It seems that with both straw bale and CEB walls will provide significant sound proofing and that the weakest link is likely going to be in the windows and doors.</p>
<p>This is how people who are really picky about sound proofing do it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anechoic_chamber" target="_blank" rel="external"><img src="/images/rf_anechoic_chamber.jpg" alt="None"></a>.</p>

    </header>
    <div class="entry">
      
        <p>Wall systems made of two CEB walls with cavity insulation lead to unusual (to other wall systems) thermal bridging problems.</p>
<p>Say you have two walls made of 4” wide block forming a 12” insulation cavity. CEBs have r-value of 0.25 while insulation have an r-value of 2.7. The total r-value is roughly 34.4 which is great:</p>
<figure class="highlight cpp"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="number">0.25</span>*<span class="number">4</span><span class="string">" + 2.7*12"</span> + <span class="number">0.25</span>*<span class="number">4</span><span class="string">" =&gt; 34.4</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Suppose that every 4 blocks, you place a block lengthwise to add some micro-buttresses which give extra strength to the wall. According to the typical linear r-value method, you would do a weighted average of the two different situations:</p>
<figure class="highlight dart"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="number">12</span><span class="string">" of insulation: 0.25*4"</span> + <span class="number">2.7</span>*<span class="number">12</span><span class="string">" + 0.25*4"</span> =&gt; <span class="number">34.4</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="number">4</span><span class="string">" of insulation: 0.25*12"</span> + <span class="number">2.7</span>*<span class="number">4</span><span class="string">" + 0.25*4"</span> =&gt; <span class="number">14.8</span></span><br><span class="line">weighted average (<span class="number">24</span><span class="string">" of 12"</span> thick insulation <span class="keyword">for</span> every <span class="number">4</span><span class="string">" of 4"</span> thick insulation):</span><br><span class="line">    (<span class="number">34.4</span>*<span class="number">24</span><span class="string">" + 14.8*4"</span>)/<span class="number">28</span><span class="string">" =&gt; 31.6</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>This predicts only a small 8.1% decrease in average r-value resulting in 8.8% of additional heat loss. Not bad given the huge amount of extra strength the micro-buttresses add.</p>
<p><img src="/images/wall.png" alt="http://dwiel.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wall.png"></p>
<h2 id="Therm">Therm</h2><p>I’ve modeled this wall system in THERM, and due to the conductivity of the CEB blocks the heat loss is actually much worse. A rough reading of the renderings THERM provides predicts roughly 50% more heat loss with the buttresses than without. This is because heat travels so well through the CEBs. In areas near to the 4” insulation gap, heat will collect over a large area of the CEB wall, funnel into the 4” thermal bridge and then spread out along the outside wall.</p>
<p>In the diagrams below, you can see the top half of the wall which has no buttresses, and the wall section below which does. The color indicates heat flow in BTU/hr*ft^2. High numbers are bad. I’ve set up the scale of the left diagram so that any white section indicates that the heat loss is more than 20% higher than it would be without the buttresses. This is most of the wall. In the second diagram you can see that large sections of the wall are loosing heat at 2.5x the rate that they would without the buttresses.</p>
<p><img src="/images/wall-20p.png" alt="http://dwiel.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wall-20p.png"> <img src="/images/wall250p.png" alt="http://dwiel.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/wall250p.png"></p>
<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>Adding buttresses can help with the strength of the wall, but detrimentally effect the insulating value of your cavity.</p>
<h2 id="The_Flip_Side">The Flip Side</h2><p>On the other hand, CEBs high conductivity makes them great at quickly absorbing and evenly distributing heat throughout the house that is gained through passive solar design. They act as great heat sinks in the winter and cool sinks in the summer.</p>
<p><a href="http://dwiel.net/files/CEB-Bridge-ose.THM" target="_blank" rel="external">Here</a> is the THERM model used in the above examples</p>
<p>Note to OSE Microhouse designers: I haven’t run this example with your proposed 2” thermal breaks, but I imagine that they will loose heat at least twice as fast as a linear analysis might predict.</p>

        <p>It appears no to matter much, but around here (Bloomington, Indiana) the most common rot resistant woods are Black Locust, White Oak and Cedar. I might just wind up using poplar because it is easy to source and cheap. Especially for the wood parts that aren’t in direct contact with the CEBs. Not sure if black Locust everywhere that touches the CEBs is overkill …</p>
<p>Tip seems to think that poplar should be fine, especially if it is coated with pine tar in places it touches the CEBs.</p>

<figure class="highlight livecodeserver"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">UnboundLocalError: <span class="built_in">local</span> <span class="built_in">variable</span> <span class="string">'y'</span> referenced <span class="keyword">before</span> assignment</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>The fix is to make sure that all variables used in foo have values at the time that it is pickled:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> x :</span><br><span class="line">    y = x</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span> :</span><br><span class="line">    y = <span class="keyword">None</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">foo</span><span class="params">()</span> :</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">print</span> y</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">cloud.pickle(foo)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Even this would be ok:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">foo</span><span class="params">()</span> :</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">print</span> y</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span> x :</span><br><span class="line">    y = x</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">else</span> :</span><br><span class="line">    y = <span class="keyword">None</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">cloud.pickle(foo)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
